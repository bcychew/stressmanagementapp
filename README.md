# stressmanagementapp

This is the web application for Computer Science Final Project CM 3070.

The title of the application is Stress Management.

The application requires Python and a virtual environment to run.


To run the code:
1. Download the zip file
2. Extract it in a folder, and install a virtual environment in that folder
3. Activate your virtual environment based on your operating system and application used
4. Install the required libraries as per the requirements.txt file attached inside with the command:
pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Finally, change directories to "venv/stressmanagementapp-main" (assuming venv as the virtual environment directory name) and run the code with the command: "python manage.py runserver", followed by opening the link: "http://127.0.0.1:8000/"

That is all.
